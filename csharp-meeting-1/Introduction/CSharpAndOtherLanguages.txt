There are many differences between them and C#. They can all be treated as object-oriented, though.
C and C++ offer better performance and portability but have less built-in features, which help the programmer
Java is the non-Microsoft rival of C# and offers many of its advantages
Objective-C is based on C and is less typesafe and managed than C# and Java. It just let's you do whatever you want and experience the consequences.
